	dt Probability theory
		a(href="https://www.cuemath.com/data/probability-theory/")
	dd A branch of mathematics that investigates the probabilities associated with a random phenomenon. A random phenomenon can have several outcomes. Probability theory describes the chance of occurrence of a particular outcome by using certain formal concepts. Probability theory makes use of some fundamentals such as sample space, probability distributions, random variables, etc. to find the likelihood of occurrence of an event. In this article, we will take a look at the definition, basics, formulas, examples, and applications of probability theory.

	dd Makes the use of random variables and probability distributions to assess uncertain situations mathematically. In probability theory, the concept of #[a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/data/probability/') probability] is used to assign a numerical description to the likelihood of occurrence of an event. Probability can be defined as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes of an event
	dd A field of mathematics and statistics that is concerned with finding the probabilities associated with random events. There are two main approaches available to study probability theory. These are theoretical probability and experimental probability. Theoretical probability is determined on the basis of logical reasoning without conducting experiments. In contrast, #[a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/data/experimental-probability/') experimental probability] is determined on the basis of historic data by performing repeated experiments.

	dd.example Suppose the probability of obtaining a number 4 on rolling a fair dice needs to be established. The number of favorable outcomes is 1. The possible outcomes of the dice are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. This implies that there are a total of 6 outcomes. Thus, the probability of obtaining 4 on a dice roll, using probability theory, can be computed as #[+m \frac 16 = 0.167].
	dt Random Experiment
	dd Can be defined as a trial that is repeated multiple times in order to get a well-defined set of possible outcomes #[span.example Tossing a coin].
	dt Sample Space
		a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/data/sample-space/')
	dd Can be defined as the set of all possible outcomes that result from conducting a random experiment. For example, the sample space of tossing a fair coin is {heads, tails}.
	dt Event
	dd A set of outcomes of an experiment that forms a subset of the sample space. The types of events are given as follows:
		ul
			li #[a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/data/independent-events/') Independent events]: Events that are not affected by other events are independent events.
			li Dependent events: Events that are affected by other events are known as dependent events.
			li Mutually exclusive events: Events that cannot take place at the same time are mutually exclusive events.
			li Equally likely events: Two or more events that have the same chance of occurring are known as equally likely events.
			li Exhaustive events: An exhaustive event is one that is equal to the sample space of an experiment.
	dt Random Variable
	dd In probability theory, a random variable can be defined as a variable that assumes the value of all possible outcomes of an experiment. There are two types of random variables as given below.
	dt Discrete Random Variable 
		a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/discrete-random-variable/')
	dd Can take an exact countable value such as 0, 1, 2... It can be described by the cumulative distribution function and the probability mass function.
	dt Continuous Random Variable
	dd A variable that can take on an infinite number of values. The cumulative distribution function and probability density function are used to define the characteristics of this variable.
	dt Probability
	dd The numerical likelihood of occurrence of an event. The probability of an event taking place will always lie between 0 and 1. This is because the number of desired outcomes can never exceed the total number of outcomes of an event. Theoretical probability and empirical probability are used in probability theory to measure the chance of an event taking place.

	dt Conditional Probability
		a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/conditional-probability-formula/')
	dd When the likelihood of occurrence of an event needs to be determined given that another event has already taken place. It is denoted as P(A | B). This represents the conditional probability of event A given that event B has already occurred.
	dt Expectation of a random variable #[+m X]
		a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/expected-value-formula/')
	dd The #[a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/data/average/') average] value of the outcomes of an experiment when it is conducted multiple times. It is denoted as E[X]. It is also known as the #[a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/data/mean/') mean] of the random variable.
	dt Variance #[+m Var[X]]
		a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/data/variance/')
	dd The measure of dispersion that shows how the distribution of a random variable varies with respect to the mean. It can be defined as the average of the squared differences from the mean of the random variable.
	dt Probability Theory Distribution Function
	dd #[a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/data/probability-distribution/') Probability distribution] or cumulative distribution function is a function that models all the possible values of an experiment along with their probabilities using a random variable. Bernoulli distribution, #[a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/binomial-distribution/') binomial distribution], are some examples of discrete probability distributions in probability theory. #[a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/normal-distribution-formula/') Normal distribution] is an example of a continuous probability distribution.
	dt Probability Mass Function
	dd The probability that a discrete random variable will be exactly equal to a specific value.
	dt Probability Density Function
	dd #[a(href='https://www.cuemath.com/data/probability-density-function/') Probability density function] is the probability that a continuous random variable will take on a set of possible values.
