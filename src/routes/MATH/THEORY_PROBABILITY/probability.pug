			p.intro Our goal is to assign probability to certain #[b events]. #[span.example.main we would like to know the probability that the outcome of rolling a fair die is an even number. In this case, our event is the set #[+m E=\{2, 4, 6\}]. If the result of our random experiment belongs to the set #[+m E], we say that the event #[+m E] has occurred].

				p Sample space is given by S, and there are two events #[+m A, B]. In a situation where event B has already occurred, then our sample space S naturally gets reduced to B because now the chances of occurrence of an event will lie inside B.
				p As we have to figure out the chances of occurrence of event A, only a portion common to both A and B is enough to represent the probability of occurrence of A, when B has already occurred. The common portion of the events is depicted by the intersection of both the events A and B #[+m A \cup B].

		+m.block P(A|B) = \frac {P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
		p Defines the probability of occurrence of an event associated with any condition. It is considered for the case of conditional probability. Also, this is known as the formula for the likelihood of “causes”.
		ol(title="Properties")
			li Let E and F be events of a sample space S of an experiment, then we have: P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1.
			li If A and B are any two events of a sample space S and F is an event of S such that P(F) ≠ 0, then; P((A ∪ B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F) – P((A \cup  B)|F)
			li P(A′|B) = 1 − P(A|B)

				summary Two dies are thrown simultaneously, and the sum of the numbers obtained is found to be 7. What is the probability that the number 3 has appeared at least once?
				p The sample space S would consist of all the numbers possible by the combination of two dies. Therefore S consists of 6 × 6, i.e. 36 events.
				p Event A indicates the combination in which 3 has appeared at least once.
				p Event B indicates the combination of the numbers which sum up to 7.

				summary In a group of 100 computer buyers, 40 bought CPU, 30 purchased monitor, and 20 purchased CPU and monitors. If a computer buyer chose at random and bought a CPU, what is the probability they also bought a Monitor?
				p As per the first event, 40 out of 100 bought CPU, so, #[+m P(A) = 40% \Leftrightarrow 0.4] 
				p Now, according to the question, 20 buyers purchased both CPU and monitors. So, this is the intersection of the happening of two events. Hence, #[+m P(A\cup B) = 20% \Leftrightarrow 0.2] 
				p By the formula of conditional probability we know: #[+m P(B|A) = \frac {P(A\cup B)}{P(B)} = 0.2/0.4 = 0.5] 
				p The probability that a buyer bought a monitor, given that they purchased a CPU, is 50%.
h4 FAQs
p(title="What is the difference between probability and conditional probability?") The main difference between the probability and the conditional probability is that probability is the likelihood of occurrence of an event say A, whereas the conditional probability defines the probability of an event by assuming another event has already occurred, i.e. in the conditional probability of A given B, the event B is assumed to have already occurred.
p(title="What does given mean in probability?") While writing the conditional probability of A given B, i.e. P(A|B), the symbol “|” represent the word “given”. This means the event after “|” is already occurred.
